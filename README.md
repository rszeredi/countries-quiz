## About the project
I love country trivia and wanted to build an app to allow users to both test their knowledge, as well as practise the lesser-known facts (eg. what's the official currency of Ecuador?). Inspiration is taken from apps that I love: Quizlet and Sporcle!

  ### About the app
  There are 4 categories of quizzes: capital cities, currencies, population, and flags. All have multi-choice modes, and the first two also feature a "type your answer" mode.

  Users can choose from two "modes":
  
    - Quiz mode: test your knowledge by completing a quiz and see your score at the end
    - Study mode: choose whether you want to study all questions, or focus on the ones you've gotten incorrect in the past
  
## Techonologies Used
This is my very first React app and uses the following tools:
  - React
    - A mixture of Functional components and Class components (note: this was not a design decision, it was purely for learning)
    - React Hooks 
    - Routing (with react-router-dom)
  - Javascript
  - CSS
  - localStorage to store users' progress
  - Material UI for the pop-up dialogs

Data is retrieved from this awesome API: [restcountries](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all)
